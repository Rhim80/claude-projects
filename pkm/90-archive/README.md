# 🗄️ Archive

Inactive items preserved for future reference.

## Purpose

The Archive stores:

- Completed projects with their outputs
- Inactive areas no longer maintained
- Old notes for historical reference
- Deprecated resources
- Past experiments and iterations

## What Goes Here

### From Projects

- Completed projects with final deliverables
- Cancelled projects with lessons learned
- Projects inactive for 30+ days

### From Areas

- Areas no longer relevant to your life
- Responsibilities you've handed off
- Roles you no longer have

### From Resources

- Outdated information (but historically interesting)
- Superseded frameworks or methods
- Old versions of evolved ideas

### From Inbox

- Processed items no longer needed
- Old daily notes (after extraction)
- Random captures without lasting value
