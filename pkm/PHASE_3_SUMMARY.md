## What Was Done

1. **Created aggressive link generator** with 4 scoring heuristics:
   - Topic clustering (leadership, PKM, branding, AI, etc.)
   - Cross-domain bonuses (knowledge ↔ projects)
   - Keyword overlap (Jaccard similarity)
   - Filename similarity

2. **Generated 3,755 link suggestions** for 539 files

3. **Applied all links automatically** by appending "## Related Notes" sections

4. **Verified results**: 541 files now have links (68% coverage)

## Link Quality Examples

### Cross-domain (Knowledge → Practice)
```markdown
# 30-knowledge/36-ai-tools/system-vs-tool-master.md
## Related Notes
- [[19th-proposal-simple]] - 높은 연관성
- [[gmail-classifier-분석]] - 높은 연관성
- [[BRAND_FRAMEWORK_ANALYSIS]] - 높은 연관성
```

### Project → Knowledge
```markdown
# 10-projects/11-consulting/gangneung-cafe-proposal-quote.md
## Related Notes
- [[창업교육-커리큘럼]] - 높은 연관성
- [[오프라인-비즈니스-운영-프로세스]] - 높은 연관성
- [[일을-잘한다는-것]] - 높은 연관성

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Review samples** - Manually check 10-20 files for link quality
2. **Create hub notes** - For high-degree nodes (>10 links)
3. **Refine reasons** - Add custom contextual reasons to key links
4. **Maintain** - Run script monthly for new files
