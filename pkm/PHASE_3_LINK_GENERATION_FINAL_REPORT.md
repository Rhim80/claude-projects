# Phase 3: Link Generation - Final Report

**Date**: October 11, 2025
**Vault**: /Users/rhim/Projects/pkm/
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 3 link generation has been successfully completed with **539 files updated** and **3,755 bidirectional links created**. The vault's link coverage has increased from **13% to 68%**, creating a highly interconnected Zettelkasten-style knowledge base.

### Key Achievements

- **Files with links**: 104 → 541 (420% increase)
- **Link coverage**: 13% (104/795) → 68% (541/795)
- **Total wiki-links**: ~600 → 4,372 (628% increase)
- **Average links per file**: 1.2 → 7.0 links
- **Bidirectional connections**: Ensured through symmetric scoring

## Methodology

### Problem: Original Approach Failed

The initial script (`generate-link-suggestions.py`) using Jaccard similarity with threshold 0.15 only generated:
- 74 files with links
- 94 total suggestions
- 1.3 avg links per file

**Root causes:**
1. Jaccard similarity too restrictive for Korean/English mixed content
2. Simple concept extraction missed semantic relationships
3. No topic-based clustering

### Solution: Aggressive Multi-Heuristic Approach

Created new script (`aggressive-link-generator.py`) using **4 scoring factors**:

#### 1. Topic-based Clustering (30% weight)
Manually defined 8 topic clusters:
- **leadership**: 리더십, playing coach, alexandr wang
- **pkm**: zettelkasten, obsidian, johnny decimal
- **branding**: 브랜딩, brand identity
- **ai-tools**: claude, gpt, n8n, automation
- **consulting**: 컨설팅, gangneung cafe
- **education**: 교육, gpters, study
- **business**: 비즈니스, market, strategy
- **cafe**: coffee, roasting, pairing

#### 2. Cross-Domain Bonus (20% weight)
Boosted connections between:
- `30-knowledge` ↔ `10-projects` (theory ↔ practice)
- `30-knowledge` ↔ `20-operations` (knowledge ↔ operations)
- `10-projects` ↔ `20-operations` (projects ↔ operations)

#### 3. Keyword Overlap (50% weight)
- Extracted top 50 Korean + English keywords per file
- Calculated Jaccard similarity
- Included headers, wikilinks, and frequent terms

#### 4. Filename Similarity (30% weight)
- Matched filename words between files
- Boosted score for files with similar names

**Final threshold**: 0.20 (cumulative score)
