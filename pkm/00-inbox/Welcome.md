# Welcome to Your AI-Powered Second Brain

This is your Inbox - a temporary landing zone for new ideas, quick captures, and daily thoughts.

## Your First Steps

1. **Start Claude Code** in this directory
2. **Tell it you're in thinking mode**: "I'm exploring [topic] in thinking mode"
3. **Let it search and ask questions** to help you think
4. **Capture insights** as you go

## Quick Tips

- Don't worry about organization initially - just capture
- Process your inbox weekly (move items to Projects/Areas/Resources)
- Use Daily Notes for stream-of-consciousness capture
- Let Claude Code help you find connections

## Try This Now

Ask Claude Code:
```
I'm new to this vault. Can you help me understand 
how to use you as a thinking partner? 
Let's explore a topic I'm curious about.
```

## Remember

The goal isn't to create perfect notes - it's to enhance your thinking. This system grows more valuable over time as you add more notes and Claude Code helps you discover connections you didn't see before.

*Move this to Archive once you're comfortable with the system*
