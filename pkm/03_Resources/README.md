## Claude Code Workflows

### Building Knowledge
```
I'm researching [topic].
What do I already have in Resources?
What gaps exist in my knowledge?
```

### Making Connections

## Resource Development

### From Consumption to Creation
1. **Capture**: Save interesting content
2. **Process**: Extract key ideas
3. **Connect**: Link to existing notes
4. **Develop**: Build your own understanding
5. **Create**: Generate original insights

### Progressive Summarization
- First pass: Highlight interesting parts
- Second pass: Bold the most important
- Third pass: Create summary at top
- Fourth pass: Extract to own note

## Claude Code Prompts

### Knowledge Audit
```
Analyze my Resources folder.
What topics am I building expertise in?
Where are the gaps?
```

### Connection Discovery
```
Find surprising connections between 
different topics in my Resources.
```

### Learning Path

Based on my resources about [topic],
what should I learn next?
Create a learning path.
```

### Concept Clarification
```
Explain [concept] using examples 
from my existing resources.
```

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions
- Clear, descriptive titles
- Include key concepts in name
- Avoid dates (unless historical)
- Use consistent formatting

### Note Structure
```markdown
# Concept Name

## Summary
One paragraph overview

## Key Points
- Main idea 1
- Main idea 2
- Main idea 3

## Connections
- Related to: [[Other Concept]]
- Contrasts with: [[Different Idea]]
- Examples: [[Case Study]]

## Sources
- Original article/book/video
```

### Maintenance
- Review and update regularly
- Merge duplicate concepts
- Strengthen connections
- Delete what's no longer relevant

## Tips

- **Quality over quantity** - Better to deeply understand few concepts
- **Your words matter** - Rewrite in your own understanding
- **Links are gold** - Connections create value
- **Review regularly** - Unused knowledge fades
- **Share freely** - Teaching solidifies understanding

## Remember

Resources are your external brain. The value isn't in collecting, but in connecting and creating. Use Claude Code to help you see patterns and build understanding across your entire knowledge base.
