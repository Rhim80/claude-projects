## Executive Summary

### Critical Issues Identified

1. **Metadata Corruption**: 168 files contain incorrect PARA system references
2. **Migration Artifacts**: 165 files still have Notion migration metadata
3. **Test/Demo Files**: 6+ training files in production vault
4. **System Mismatch**: User uses Johnny Decimal, not PARA method

### Recommended Actions

- **DELETE**: 6-12 files (demo files, near-empty files)
- **METADATA FIX**: 168+ files (remove PARA, fix tags, update categories)
- **KEEP**: ~778 files (after cleanup and corrections)
- **LINK ENHANCEMENT**: 850+ bidirectional link suggestions pending Phase 2

---

## Part 1: DELETE Candidates

### Category A: Demo/Training Files (DELETE - 6 files)

**Reasoning**: These are Notion basic training files from "노션 기초 강의", not actual vault content.

```
❌ /10-projects/12-education/12.01-imi-ai-study/Claude + MCP +n8n 자동화 실습 Study/노션 기초 강의/할아버지 페이지 (강의 실습용)/배민/배민.md
   - Reason: Training example, CSV link only, 8 words
   - Content: "# 배민 [제목 없음](%EB%B0%B0%EB%AF%BC/%EC%A0%9C%EB%AA%A9%20%EC%97%86%EC%9D%8C.csv)"

❌ /10-projects/12-education/12.01-imi-ai-study/Claude + MCP +n8n 자동화 실습 Study/노션 기초 강의/할아버지 페이지 (강의 실습용)/할아버지 페이지 (강의 실습용).md
   - Reason: Notion training demo (2025-03-22 workshop exercise)
   - Content: Markdown syntax training examples

❌ /10-projects/12-education/12.01-imi-ai-study/Claude + MCP +n8n 자동화 실습 Study/노션 기초 강의/할아버지 페이지 (강의 실습용)/엄마 페이지/엄마 페이지.md
   - Reason: Sub-demo page for training
   - Content: Markdown explanation for beginners

❌ /10-projects/12-education/12.01-imi-ai-study/Claude + MCP +n8n 자동화 실습 Study/노션 기초 강의/할아버지 페이지 (강의 실습용)/엄마 페이지/자녀 페이지/자녀 페이지.md
   - Reason: Nested demo page, 1 link only
   - Content: "# 자녀 페이지 [[증손녀]]"

❌ /10-projects/12-education/12.01-imi-ai-study/Claude + MCP +n8n 자동화 실습 Study/노션 기초 강의/할아버지 페이지 (강의 실습용)/엄마 페이지/자녀 페이지/증손녀.md
   - Reason: Empty nested demo (0 content beyond title)
   - Content: "# 증손녀" (empty)

❌ /10-projects/12-education/12.01-imi-ai-study/Claude + MCP +n8n 자동화 실습 Study/노션 기초 강의/노션 기초 강의.md
   - Reason: Just a link to Google Drive training video
   - Content: External links, not knowledge content
```

**Recommendation**: DELETE entire folder structure:
```bash
rm -rf "/Users/rhim/Projects/pkm/10-projects/12-education/12.01-imi-ai-study/Claude + MCP +n8n 자동화 실습 Study/노션 기초 강의/할아버지 페이지 (강의 실습용)"
```

Keep only: `/노션 기초 강의.md` (as it references the training video for students)

### Category B: Near-Empty Files (PENDING FULL SCAN)

**Status**: Requires comprehensive scan of all 796 files
**Expected**: 5-10 additional files with <50 words and no unique value

---

## Part 2: METADATA CORRECTION Required

### Issue 1: PARA System References (168 files)

**Problem**: Files contain `tags: ["para-system", "db-areas"]` but user uses **Johnny Decimal system**.

**Example (WRONG)**:
```yaml
---
title: "Claude + MCP +n8n 자동화 실습 Study"
tags:
  - "para-system"        # ❌ WRONG - User doesn't use PARA
  - "db-areas"           # ❌ WRONG - Not Johnny Decimal terminology
  - "imi-ai-study"
---
```

**Correct Format**:
```yaml
---
title: "Claude + MCP +n8n 자동화 실습 Study"
tags: [education, ai-study, automation, workshop]
category: 12-education
project: 12.01-imi-ai-study
source: notion-migration
---
```

### Issue 2: Notion Migration Artifacts (165 files)

**Problem**: Files retain Notion-specific metadata that's irrelevant in Obsidian.

**What to remove**:
- `notion-id:` - No longer needed
- `folder:` with emoji PARA structure - Outdated path
- `aliases:` with Notion ID hashes - Unnecessary
- `published: false` - Not publishing to Notion anymore

**What to keep/transform**:
- `title:` - Keep as is
- `tags:` - **Fix to reflect actual topics**, remove "para-system", "db-areas"
- Add `category:` (Johnny Decimal folder)
- Add `source: notion-migration` (for historical tracking)

### Issue 3: Incorrect Source Tags

**Problem**: Many files say `source: notion-para-projects` when they should reflect actual origin.

**Corrections needed**:
- Notion exports → `source: notion-migration`
- Workflowy exports → `source: workflowy-migration`
- Native PKM files → remove `source` field

---

## Part 3: KEEP Files (Quality Assessment)

### High-Quality Files (Strong KEEP)

**Examples**:
```
✅ /10-projects/README.md (115 lines, clear structure, useful guidance)
✅ /10-projects/12-education/README.md (78 lines, business context, project overview)
✅ /10-projects/13-imi-work/README.md (98 lines, brand identity, architecture docs)
✅ /10-projects/14-brand-identity/README.md (115 lines, PRD summary, tech stack)
✅ /10-projects/11-consulting/11.01-gangneung-cafe-2025/README.md (116 lines, project scope, timeline)
✅ /10-projects/11-consulting/11.01-gangneung-cafe-2025/proposal-explanation.md (270 lines, detailed client proposal)
✅ /10-projects/12-education/12.02-gpters-ai-branding/README.md (83 lines, cohort management, curriculum)
```

**Quality Indicators**:
- Clear single purpose
- 50-2000 words range
- Well-structured with headers
- Contains unique insights or business value
- Potential for linking to related notes

### Medium-Quality Files (KEEP with improvements)

**Characteristics**:
- Minimal content but still valuable
- Missing "Related Notes" section
- Could benefit from linking
- Metadata needs correction

**Required Improvements**:
- Fix PARA/Notion metadata
- Add Johnny Decimal category tags
- Add "## Related Notes" section (Phase 3)
- Extract key concepts for linking

---

## Part 4: SPLIT Candidates (TBD)

**Status**: Requires word count analysis of all files
**Expected**: 10-20 files >2000 words covering multiple distinct topics

**Methodology for Phase 2**:
1. Scan all files for word count
2. Identify files >2000 words
3. Analyze topic coherence
4. Propose split points and new filenames

---

## Part 5: Metadata Correction Strategy

### Batch 1: PARA References (168 files)

**Script Logic**:
```python
For each file with "para-system" or "db-areas" in tags:
  1. Read YAML frontmatter
  2. Remove: "para-system", "db-areas", "published"
  3. Remove: "notion-id", "folder" (with PARA emoji structure)
  4. Remove: aliases with Notion ID hashes
  5. Add: "category: [Johnny Decimal folder]"
  6. Transform tags: Keep topic tags, add relevant categories
  7. Add: "source: notion-migration" (if Notion origin)
  8. Write back to file
```

### Batch 2: Notion ID Cleanup (165 files)

**Fields to remove**:
- `notion-id:`
- `folder:` (if contains emoji and PARA structure)
- `aliases:` (if contains Notion hash IDs)

### Batch 3: Tag Transformation

**Old → New mapping**:
```
para-system → [DELETE]
db-areas → [DELETE]
imi-ai-study → [education, ai-study]
claude-mcp-n8n-study → [automation, workshop, claude, n8n]
consulting → [consulting, branding] (context-dependent)
```

## Part 6: Implementation Plan

### Step 1: User Approval Required

**Before proceeding, confirm**:
1. ✅ DELETE 6 demo/training files from "할아버지 페이지 (강의 실습용)"
2. ✅ FIX metadata in 168 files (remove PARA, add Johnny Decimal)
3. ✅ REMOVE Notion artifacts from 165 files
4. ✅ Proceed to Phase 2 (semantic analysis + linking)

### Step 2: Execution Order

**Priority 1: DELETE (5 minutes)**
- Remove demo files
- Clean up empty directory structures

**Priority 2: METADATA CORRECTION (30-60 minutes)**
- Batch process 168 files with PARA references
- Batch process 165 files with Notion IDs
- Verify random sample (10 files) after changes

**Priority 3: FULL VAULT SCAN (60+ minutes)**
- Scan all 790 remaining files
- Identify additional DELETE candidates
- Identify SPLIT candidates
- Extract key concepts for Phase 2

### Step 3: Quality Checks

**After each batch**:
- Git commit with descriptive message
- Verify 10 random files
- Check for broken links
- Ensure YAML syntax valid

---

## Part 7: Expected Outcomes

### Before Cleanup
- Total files: 796
- Files with bad metadata: 168
- Files with Notion artifacts: 165
- Demo/test files: 6
- Link coverage: ~20%

### After Phase 1 (Quality + Metadata)
- Total files: ~790 (after DELETE)
- Clean metadata: 100%
- Johnny Decimal aligned: 100%
- Ready for linking: Yes

### After Phase 3 (Linking)
- Link coverage: 90%+
- Average links/file: 4-5
- Hub notes created: 8-10
- Isolated notes: <10%

---

## Part 8: Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Metadata corrections (reversible via git)
- DELETE of demo files (clearly identified)
- Adding "Related Notes" sections (non-destructive)

### Medium Risk
- Bulk tag transformation (need careful mapping)
- Removing Notion IDs (might break some workflows?)

### Mitigation
- Git commit after every batch
- Keep backup before starting
- Test on sample first (10 files)
- Document all transformations

## Next Steps

**AWAITING USER APPROVAL** to proceed with:

1. ✅ **DELETE 6 demo files** - Safe, clearly training materials
2. ✅ **FIX 168 files** with PARA metadata - Replace with Johnny Decimal
3. ✅ **REMOVE Notion artifacts** from 165 files - Clean migration leftovers
4. ⏭️ **PROCEED TO PHASE 2** - Semantic analysis + link suggestions

**Estimated Time**:
- Phase 1 execution: 60-90 minutes
- Phase 2 (semantic analysis): 120+ minutes
- Phase 3 (link implementation): 60-90 minutes
- Phase 4 (hub notes + report): 30 minutes

**Total Project Time**: 4-6 hours

## Questions for User

1. **Demo files**: Confirm DELETE of "할아버지 페이지 (강의 실습용)" training files?
2. **Metadata strategy**: Approve transformation of PARA → Johnny Decimal tags?
3. **Notion IDs**: Safe to remove `notion-id` fields completely?
4. **Execution preference**:
   - Option A: Full automation (faster, needs review after)
   - Option B: Batch approval (slower, more control)
   - Option C: Sample first (10 files), then full run
