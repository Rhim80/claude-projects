## The 10-Minute Dashboard

It’s Monday morning. You drop a sales CSV into Claude Code.

Ten minutes later, you’re looking at an interactive dashboard: revenue is trending up, top products are highlighted, and customer patterns are visible. You hover over any chart—exact numbers appear. Click a product—it expands with customer details.

No Excel formulas. No pivot tables. No manual chart formatting.

Just insights.

**This is Week 6: Visual Intelligence.**

## Why Dashboards Beat Reports

Here’s what used to happen:

**You:** “Claude, analyze my sales data”

**AI:** _\[Generates 500 words of analysis\]_

**You:** _\[Spends 10 minutes reading to find the one thing that matters\]_

Here’s what happens now:

**You:** _\[Glances at dashboard for 30 seconds\]_

**You:** _\[Sees exactly what needs attention\]_

**You:** _\[Takes action\]_

### The Visual Advantage

Your brain processes images thousands of times faster than text. You can spot patterns in charts that would take paragraphs to explain.

**Text analysis:** Linear. One insight at a time. Requires reading everything.

**Visual dashboard:** Parallel. Multiple insights simultaneously. Scan for what matters.

## The 10-Minute Build

**What you need:**

- Any business data (CSV, Excel export, whatever)

- Claude Code open

- The prompt below


**Ready? Here’s the exact prompt that builds your dashboard:**

```
Create an interactive React sales dashboard that automatically monitors
CSV files and updates in real-time when data changes.

Get the Data Files

First, download the week 6 data files:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/13CAQD5Vbq0ZYFKQF-9eZryLfUzrwB_eT/view?usp=sharing

Extract the ZIP file and you’ll find several CSV files with sample sales
data. Use these files as your data source for the dashboard.

Project Requirements

Create a React application that includes:

Core Features
- Real-time Data Loading: Monitor CSV files and auto-update every 5
  seconds when changes are detected
- Smart Change Detection: Only refresh when data actually changes
  (prevent unnecessary flickering)
- Interactive Charts:
  - Revenue trend line chart with hover tooltips
  - Top products bar chart with color coding
- Key Metrics Dashboard: Display total revenue, order count, and average
  order value with trend indicators (green for up, red for down)
- Professional Design: Clean, responsive layout that works on desktop
  and mobile
- Error Handling: Graceful fallbacks if CSV loading fails

Technical Implementation
- Use React for the frontend framework
- Use Recharts for chart visualization
- Use Papa Parse for CSV file processing
- Use Lucide React for icons
- Implement hash-based change detection to prevent unnecessary updates
- Store CSV files in the public/data/csv/ directory
- Auto-refresh data every 5 seconds using polling

Data Structure

The CSV files contain sales data with columns like:
- Date, Product, Customer, Region, Quantity, Unit_Price, Total_Revenue,
  Sales_Rep, Customer_Type

Use this data to:
- Calculate daily revenue trends
- Identify top-performing products
- Compute key business metrics
- Show month-over-month percentage changes

Getting Started

1. Create a new React app: npx create-react-app sales-dashboard
2. Install required dependencies: npm install recharts lucide-react papaparse
3. Set up the project structure with components for the dashboard
4. Place the downloaded CSV files in public/data/csv/
5. Implement the data loading and visualization features

Success Criteria

Your dashboard should:
- Load and display data from the provided CSV files
- Update automatically when CSV files are modified
- Show smooth, professional-looking charts and metrics
- Handle errors gracefully
- Provide an intuitive user experience

The goal is to create a production-quality dashboard that demonstrates
real-time data handling, professional visualization techniques, and modern
React development patterns.
```

**What happens next:**

1. Claude Code reads the requirements (30 seconds)

2. Generates the complete dashboard application (3-4 minutes)

3. Sets up the React project structure (2 minutes)

4. Creates interactive visualizations (2 minutes)

5. You run it and see your business (instant)


**Total time:** Under 10 minutes

**The result:** A professional dashboard that auto-updates every 5 seconds when your data changes.

## Using Your Own Data

**Want to use your actual business data instead of the samples?**

Simple. Replace the sample CSV files with your own:

1. Export your sales/marketing/customer data as CSV

2. Drop it in the `public/data/csv/` folder

3. Ensure your columns are labeled (e.g., Date, Product, Revenue).

4. The dashboard automatically adapts to your data structure


**Pro tip:** Start with the sample data to see how it works, then replace it with your actual data. This allows you to validate that the dashboard works before customizing it.

## Make It Intelligent

Your dashboard now shows what’s happening. Let’s make it tell you what it means.

**Add this follow-up prompt:**

```
Add an AI Insights panel to the dashboard that:

1. Analyzes the data and identifies:
   - Top 3 opportunities (trends moving up, strong performers)
   - Top 3 concerns (trends moving down, at-risk areas)

2. For each insight, provide:
   - What changed (specific numbers)
   - Why it matters (business impact)
   - Recommended action (what I should do)

3. Use my business context in the data folder to personalize recommendations based on my business priorities

4. Display insights in a clean panel below the charts with:
   - Color coding (green for opportunities, yellow for concerns)
   - Click to expand for more details
   - “Last analyzed” timestamp

Make the insights actionable and specific, not generic observations.
```

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DA3T!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faeb853cf-0c10-464e-8c7d-a82b9fffc139_1320x1534.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DA3T!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faeb853cf-0c10-464e-8c7d-a82b9fffc139_1320x1534.png)

**What you get:**

Not just pretty charts. Charts + AI interpretation + specific actions.

**Example insight:**

> **Customer ‘Acme Corp’ Activity Declining**
>
> **What changed:** Last order was 22 days ago (typical frequency: 14 days)
>
> **Why it matters:** Acme is a top-5 customer ($47K lifetime value)
>
> **Recommended action:** Schedule check-in call this week. Draft email available.
>
> _\[Click to expand for email draft and full purchase history\]_

This is where the first 5 weeks pay compound dividends. The AI knows your business context, so insights are relevant, not random.

## The Auto-Update Magic

Here’s the best part: **You never manually update this dashboard.**

**How it works:**

1. **Monday morning:** Export fresh data from your systems (CRM, accounting, etc.)

2. **Drop the file:** Replace the CSV in your `public/data/csv/` folder

3. **Automatic refresh:** Dashboard detects the change and updates within 5 seconds

4. **Review over coffee:** Scan the dashboard (30 seconds)

5. **Take action:** Click insights that need attention


**Weekly time investment:**

- Week 1 setup: 10 minutes

- Week 2+: 30 seconds to update data, 5 minutes to review


**Annual time savings:** 140+ hours

**The compound effect:**

Each week, your dashboard:

- Shows you patterns you’d miss in spreadsheets

- Catches problems before they become crises

- Surfaces opportunities while they’re still fresh

- Learns which insights you act on (via Week 5 memory)


After a month, you’ll wonder how you ever managed without it.

* * *

## Troubleshooting

**“My data doesn’t look like the sample format”**

→ Claude Code can adapt. Just tell it: “My CSV has columns X, Y, Z. Adjust the dashboard to use these instead.”

**“The dashboard won’t load”**

→ Check that your CSV files are in `public/data/csv/` and the React app is running ( `npm start`)

**“I want different charts”**

→ Ask Claude Code: “Replace the bar chart with a pie chart showing revenue by region”

**“The insights are too generic”**

→ Enhance your Week 5 memory with specific business rules. The more context the AI has, the more relevant its insights.

**“Can I share this with my team?”**

→ Yes. Deploy it to Vercel/Netlify (free) or export as a standalone HTML file for email sharing.

* * *

## BONUS: The Spreadsheet Alternative

**If you prefer Excel over dashboards:**

Use Claude Desktop (not Claude Code) with this prompt:

```
Create an interactive Excel dashboard with:
- My sales data imported
- Pivot tables for key metrics
- Auto-updating charts (revenue, products, customers)
- Conditional formatting (green=up, red=down)
- Insights sheet with AI-generated recommendations

Export as .xlsx file
```

Download the file and you’re done. Same intelligence, familiar tool.

**The bridge approach:**

Start with Excel if dashboards feel too foreign. Once you see the power of automated insights, the jump to interactive web dashboards becomes easier.

## The Strategic Reality

**Six weeks ago, you were a Claude beginner.**

**Today, you have:**

- ✅ An AI agent with business memory (Week 5)

- ✅ Auto-updating visual intelligence (Week 6)

- ✅ Pattern recognition in seconds, not hours

- ✅ Proactive insights, not reactive reporting


**In 10 minutes, you built something most companies assign to entire business intelligence teams.**

**The competitive gap:**

While others spend Monday morning building Excel reports, you’re already acting on opportunities your dashboard surfaced Sunday night.

**The question:**

If you can have visual business intelligence in 10 minutes, what’s stopping you?

* * *

## Your Week 6 Challenge

**This week:**

1. Download the sample data

2. Copy the prompt into Claude Code

3. Generate your dashboard (10 minutes)

4. Replace sample data with your real data

5. Add the AI insights panel (5 minutes)


**That’s it.**

No complex setup. No extensive configuration. Just results.

Sharea screenshot of your dashboard (you can blur your data if you prefer). I'd like to see what you've built. When you reply with your screenshot, tell me: What’s the first insight your dashboard revealed that you didn’t expect?

* * *

## Week 7 Preview: “Your AI Board of Advisors”

**Coming next week:** Create your first subagents with Claude

Your dashboard shows what’s happening.

Next week: Multiple specialized AI agents work together to tell you what to do about it.

**The scenario:**

Your Sales Agent notices a customer churn signal. It alerts your Marketing Agent, who drafts a win-back campaign. Your Finance Agent calculates the ROI. Your Operations Agent checks if the product is in stock.

All of this happens before you even see the alert.

**This is the start of learning agent orchestration.**

And it’s where true AI leverage compounds and where casual users and power users permanently diverge.

Multi-agent orchestration isn’t just ‘more advanced’—it’s a fundamentally different way of working with AI. Miss this week, and catching up becomes exponentially harder..
