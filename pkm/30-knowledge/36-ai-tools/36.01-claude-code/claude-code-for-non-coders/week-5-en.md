**AI Competency Level:** 2.5 - Advanced Prompt Engineering with Memory

**Learning Objective:** Create persistent, intelligent systems that compound knowledge across sessions

**Time Investment:** 45-60 minutes to build, saves 5+ hours weekly, ongoing

* * *

### The AI Memory Problem

**Scenario Setup:** “You open Claude Code (or ChatGPT, OpenCode, Gemini, etc) to analyze this week’s sales data. But Claude has completely forgotten everything from last week’s analysis:

- Your company’s strategic priorities

- The analysis framework you spent 30 minutes perfecting last week

- The business context that makes certain metrics meaningful

- The insights from previous weeks that should inform today’s analysis


You’re starting from zero. Again.”

**The Solution Preview:** What if Claude Code remembered everything? Not just the prompts, but your business context, your strategic thinking, and the patterns it’s learned about your organization?

That’s Context Engineering - and it’s the difference between using AI and orchestrating intelligence.

## Week 5 Data Playground: Context Templates and Prompts

I’ve prepared context templates and prompts for you to practice with:

- **Strategic Context** (Company’s strategic foundation and decision-making priorities)

- **Operational Context** (Operational reality of how your business actually runs)

- **Analysis Preferences** (Teach Claude Code how YOU personally think about data)

- **Previous Insights** (Institutional memory that compounds intelligence over time)

- **Marketing Advisor** (Domain-expert persona for marketing strategy and ROI analysis)

- **Prompt Chain** (Pre-built 6-step workflow for comprehensive strategic analysis)

- **Analysis Log** (Session-by-session record that creates continuity across time)


_Download all templates and prompts [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fv65cnpWVQCJT4m-rhoiwctYU_OR1njA/view?usp=share_link) – we’ll use them throughout this exercise._

* * *

## **THE CONTEXT ENGINEERING MINDSET**

### From Stateless to Stateful Intelligence

**Core Concept:**

- Week 4: Built single-session intelligence systems

- Week 5: Creating persistent knowledge that compounds

- The shift: From “telling” Claude Code each time to “teaching” it once


**Business Impact:**

- Executive A: Spends 15 minutes every Monday re-explaining business context

- Executive B: Has context pre-loaded, jumps straight to strategic questions

- **Time Savings:** 2-3 hours per week in context setup

- **Quality Improvement:** Deeper insights from accumulated knowledge


**AI Competency Framework Connection:** Link back to [AI Competence and Mastery article](https://dewilliamsco.substack.com/p/ai-competence-and-mastery-for-everyone)

- Level 3: Context Management (what we’re building toward)

- This week bridges Level 2 → 3 with advanced techniques

   - Company mission and strategic priorities

   - Key performance indicators that matter

   - Current quarter/year goals

   - Competitive landscape

   - Market position and challenges
2. **Operational Context Document**

   - How your business operates

   - Department structures and responsibilities

   - Key processes and workflows

   - Decision-making frameworks

   - Budget constraints and priorities
3. **Analysis Preferences Document**

   - Your communication style

   - How you think about data

   - Types of insights you value

   - Action-oriented vs. exploratory analysis preferences

   - Stakeholder presentation requirements
4. **Historical Insights Repository**

   - Past analysis findings

   - Decisions made and rationale

   - Lessons learned

   - Successful strategies

   - Failed experiments and why

**Practical Exercise:** Using last week’s marketing and sales analysis as the foundation, create your first context documents.

**Template Provided (strategic-context.md available in this week’s download assets):**

```
# Strategic Context - [Your Company Name]

## Mission & Vision
[Core purpose and strategic direction]

## Q4 2025 Strategic Priorities
1. [Priority with success metrics]
2. [Priority with success metrics]
3. [Priority with success metrics]

1. [First priority - e.g., revenue impact]
2. [Second priority - e.g., customer retention]
3. [Third priority - e.g., operational efficiency]

```

* * *

## **SPECIALIZED ANALYSIS PERSONAS**

### Creating Context-Aware AI Agents

**Concept:** Instead of one generic Claude Code interaction, create specialized personas that know your business context AND have domain expertise.

**Four Essential Personas:**

1. **The Strategic Advisor**

   - Knows: Company strategy, competitive landscape, long-term goals

   - Purpose: High-level insights for executive decision-making

   - When to use: Board prep, quarterly planning, strategic pivots
2. **The Operations Analyst**

   - Knows: Day-to-day operations, efficiency metrics, process flows

   - Purpose: Tactical recommendations for operational improvements

   - When to use: Weekly reviews, process optimization, resource allocation
3. **The Market Intelligence Specialist**

   - Knows: Customer segments, competitive positioning, market trends

   - Purpose: Customer and market-focused insights

   - When to use: Marketing strategy, customer retention, competitive response
4. **The Financial Controller**

   - Knows: Budget constraints, revenue targets, cost structures

   - Purpose: Financial impact analysis and ROI calculations

   - When to use: Budget planning, investment decisions, cost optimization

**Building Your First Persona (marketing-persona.md available in this week’s download assets):**

Run this prompt in the Claude Code terminal:

```
PERSONA: Strategic Marketing Advisor

ROLE: You are my Strategic Marketing Advisor with deep knowledge of our business context.

BUSINESS KNOWLEDGE:
[Reference Strategic Context Document]
[Reference Historical Marketing Performance Data]

EXPERTISE AREAS:
- B2B marketing strategy
- ROI-focused campaign analysis
- Customer acquisition cost optimization
- Multi-channel attribution

ANALYSIS APPROACH:
When analyzing marketing data, you:
1. Connect campaigns to strategic business priorities
2. Calculate true ROI including customer lifetime value
3. Identify high-performing channels for scale
4. Recommend budget reallocation based on performance
5. Flag early warning signs in campaign metrics

COMMUNICATION STYLE:
- Lead with business impact, not vanity metrics
- Provide 3 strategic recommendations maximum
- Include specific budget/resource implications
- Reference past campaign learnings when relevant

CONTEXT AWARENESS:
You remember our previous marketing analyses, our strategic priorities for Q4 2025, and our competitive positioning challenges.

When I provide new marketing data, analyze it through this comprehensive lens.

```

**Practical Exercise:** Build a Strategic Advisor persona using your Week 4 analysis as the historical context.

## **CROSS-SESSION INTELLIGENCE**

### Making Claude Code Remember

**The Challenge:** Claude Code is stateless by default - each conversation starts fresh.

**Three Techniques for Persistence:**

### Technique 1: Context Document Library

**Setup:**

- Create markdown files for each context type

- Store in a dedicated project folder

- Reference at the start of each session


**Implementation:**

```
At the start of each Claude Code session:
“Load business context from:
- strategic-context.md
- operations-context.md
- analysis-preferences.md
- previous-insights.md (last updated: [date])”

```

### Technique 2: Session Continuity Logs

**Purpose:** Track insights and decisions across sessions

**Template:**

```
# Analysis Session Log - Week [X]

## Date: [Date]
## Data Analyzed: [Datasets used]
## Key Findings:
1. [Finding with business impact]
2. [Finding with business impact]

## Decisions Made:
- [Decision] based on [insight]
- [Decision] based on [insight]

## Actions Taken:
- [Action item assigned to whom]

## Next Session Focus:
- [What to analyze next]
- [Questions to answer]

## Context Updates:
- [New learnings to add to context documents]

```

### Technique 3: Prompt Chains with Memory Handoffs (Recommended)

**Concept:** Multi-step analysis where each step builds on the previous context

**Example Workflow:**

```
Step 1: Historical Context Loading
“Review our last 4 weeks of marketing analysis. Summarize:
- What we learned
- What strategies we implemented
- What’s working vs. not working”

Step 2: Current Analysis
“Now analyze this week’s marketing data in context of:
- Historical patterns you just reviewed
- Our strategic priorities
- Previous recommendations we implemented”

Step 3: Forward-Looking Synthesis
“Based on:
- Historical patterns
- Current week performance
- Our strategic goals
Create a 4-week forward plan with specific metrics to track”

Step 4: Context Update
“Update our historical insights document with:
- New patterns discovered
- Strategy adjustments made
- Metrics to monitor going forward”

```

**Practical Exercise:** Take your Week 4 marketing analysis and create a 3-step prompt chain that:

1. Loads Week 4 insights as context

2. Analyzes new week’s data comparatively

3. Updates your insights repository


* * *

## **COMPLEX MULTI-STEP ANALYSIS IN ACTION**

### Orchestrating Intelligence Workflows

**Real Business Scenario:** “Our Q4 revenue is tracking 15% below target. Figure out why and what to do about it.”

**The Multi-Step Prompt Chain:**

```
STEP 1: Data Aggregation & Pattern Recognition
“Load and analyze ./data/csv/*.csv files:
- Sales data (Q2 2025: April-June transactions)
- Marketing campaign data (Q2 2025: April-June campaigns)
- Customer data (Q2 2025: new vs. returning customers)

Identify patterns and trends within Q2 data.
Focus on: conversion rates, deal sizes, sales cycle length, customer segments, monthly progression.”

STEP 2: Root Cause Analysis
“Based on the patterns identified:
1. Correlate marketing spend to sales outcomes
2. Segment analysis by customer type and region
3. Compare sales rep performance
4. Identify which products and regions are underperforming

Reference our strategic context - which priorities are most affected?”

STEP 3: Cross-Functional Impact Assessment
“Evaluate how Q2 performance trends affect:
- Budget allocations for Q3/Q4 2025
- Hiring plans
- Product development timeline
- Customer success resources

Use our operational context to understand cascading effects.”

STEP 4: Strategic Recommendations
“As my Strategic Advisor persona:
Create 3 action plans (aggressive/moderate/conservative) that:
- Address patterns and opportunities identified
- Are achievable within Q3/Q4 2025 timeline
- Include resource requirements
- Show expected revenue impact

Prioritize based on our decision-making framework.”

STEP 5: Implementation Roadmap
“For the moderate action plan:
- Break into 2-week sprints
- Assign to departments (Marketing, Sales, Operations)
- Define success metrics for each sprint
- Create monitoring dashboard requirements

Format as executive presentation outline.”

STEP 6: Update Context Repository
“Document in our historical insights:
- Q2 2025 performance analysis
- Key patterns and opportunities discovered
- Strategy chosen and why
- Expected outcomes
- Monitoring plan
- strategic-context.md
- operations-context.md
- previous-insights.md
- analysis-log.md”
```
